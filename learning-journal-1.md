#LEARNING JOURNAL

Today went well as far as the material that was presented in class. The most difficult portion of the day was the lab section, where I felt at times that I was unable to get into a rhythm because folks were coming to ask me stuff. I determined at the outset that I kind of wanted to be "that guy", the one thatothers in the class could look to for quality information and assistance, and I think I was unprepared for what that might mean as far as being able to attend to my own stuff. I believe that I am seeing a hint of the importance of the headphones rule, and the reality of what distractions can do to one's workflow. I believe that this need for contemplative concentration, and the need to guard it, will only grow in importance both now in the CF dynamic as well as in an actual development environment.

I also realized that I'm probably not a good fit for front-end, which I suspected from the outset. I'm already finding the process of creating layouts to be tedious, and would rather spend time working on the problem solving and data manipulation components.
