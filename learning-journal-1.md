# LEARNING JOURNAL

Today went well as far as the material that was presented in class. The most difficult portion of the day was the lab section, where I felt at times that I was unable to get into a rhythm because folks were coming to ask me stuff. I determined at the outset that I kind of wanted to be "that guy", the one thatothers in the class could look to for quality information and assistance, and I think I was unprepared for what that might mean as far as being able to attend to my own stuff. I believe that I am seeing a hint of the importance of the headphones rule, and the reality of what distractions can do to one's workflow. I believe that this need for contemplative concentration, and the need to guard it, will only grow in importance both now in the CF dynamic as well as in an actual development environment.

I also realized that I'm probably not a good fit for front-end, which I suspected from the outset. I'm already finding the process of creating layouts to be tedious, and would rather spend time working on the problem solving and data manipulation components.

I actually learned something pretty important today. The lesson came as I was looking at the stretch goals for the day's lab. One of them was to print out a different table, and I realized then that I wouldn't be able to print that out using largely existing code. I built a function that tabulated a specific array, when what I *should* have done was built a function that tabulated *any* array. Then I could have made two more specific functions - one for each table type - that both used the more generic array tabulator function. Had I known about that stretch goal from the outset (yes I should have fully read the document before doing anything) then I would have designed it that way to begin with - but that got me thinking about reality, and how undoubtedly something will be built to spec and then additional functionality will be requested later, so realistically all code should be designed with that inevitability in mind right from the outset. So I'm actually glad that I didn't read the instructions, because it taught me to #1 read the instructions and #2 build the most general purpose, extensible code possible pretty much always, because you have no idea what you will be tasked to add in the future. Good freaking lesson.

Well, today I think the big takeaway lesson was that I should probably not attempt to bite off more than I can chew. By which I mean I was feeling fairly ambitious on what I wanted to accomplish, but ran into a bit of unexpected trouble, was unfortunately delayed, and ended up spending pretty much all day on this up until bed time, which is definitely not what I would have preferred. Get core functionality done first - or whatever milestones you're supposed to hit - then go back and work on improvements, not the other way around!
